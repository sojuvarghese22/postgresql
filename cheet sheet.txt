1. \l gives list of all databasesd 
2. CREATE DATABASE(USE TO CREATE DATABASE)
3. \? to go out 
4. -h hostname(remote server/local) -p portno -U username database name (for connecting to database server)
   eg: -h localhost -p 5432 -U amigoscode test1
5.\q to exist
7. \c ( used for  connecting to database)
8. DROP DATABASE databasename(use to delete the database)
9. after every command give ';' at last
10. command for creating table 
eg: CREATE TABLE table name(coumnname, datatype, size);
eg: CREATE TABLE person(id INT,
                        first_name VARCHAR(50),
                        last_name VARCHAR(50),

11. \d (use to display all the table of the database)
12. \d tablename(give all detail of specific table like what are all columns with name  all datatype of all column , and all the constraints that were define for all the columns)
13. DROP TABLE tablename(use to delete table)
14. \i location = is used for importing data
15. SELECT * from tablename ORDER_BY name ASC(optional)/SELECT * from tablename DESC (for sorting in ascending order or descending order ) 
16 WHERE = is used for selecting particular field and from that field retrieve data
*note for consraint(NOT NULL: simply means that column will not contain blank data, PRIMARY KEY: when we want that specific column should uniquely identifies row then we will PRIMARY KEY )
17. comparison operators: <,<=,>,>=,(*important  = is used to compare eg 1=1 gives true), <> means not equal to
18. LIMIT (is used to  display the starting specified number of rows)
19. OFFSET (is used to display from which rows to display)
20. Fetch work same as LIMIT
21. in (is used when we want mutiple row to used for retrieving row 
22. BETWEEN (is used when we want to select row from specific starting and ending point for eg give the people which as birth date 2000 to 2010 so query will be SELECT * FROM person WHERE birth_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010)  
23. LIKE and ILIKE (used to finda row with specific character like we want row which has last 3 character ese then query will be SELECT * FROM person where name LIKE '%ese' and like is case sensitive so if lowercase want then specify lower case and vise versa but ILIKE is not case sensitive )
*note (BIGSERIAL is used when we want that database only assign unique increment id)
24. GROUP BY is used to  group for example i want country name along with no of people live in that country then we will use GROUP BY and the query is SELECT country, count(*) GROUP BY country 
25. HAVING (used with GROUP BY)
25. NOW() (use to find curent date,time)
    a. NOW()::DATE (gives only date)
    b. NOW()::TIME (gives only time)
    c. INTERVAL (if we want to see past date,time or future then we use INTERVAL for eg (NOW() - INTERVAL '1 YEAR')::DATE)
